# EasyCook

## Instruction

EasyCook is a object-oriented programming exercice project and aim to navigate a player through lists of food options and let the
player to choose what food to cook. This program will prompt a recipe file of foods selected by
the player in the end.

The player shall use Python3 in command line to open the recipe.py file. This program has
four options in the main menu, including “Select food”, “View selected food and recipe”,
“Finish”, and “Help”. “Select food” guides the player to four food categories, including
“Protein”, “Veggie”, “Dessert”, and “Drink”. Each food category prompts food options and their
cooking methods for player to choose from. Based on player’s preference, a recipe will be
generated at the end of food category and the end of the program. “View selected food and
recipe” guides the player to a list of food the player already selected. “Finish” allows the player
to exit the program with a pile of recipes. “Help” directs the player to a detailed instruction file
for reference. In order to make a choice, the player should type in the number that displayed
ahead of each option; otherwise, the program will ask again for a valid number.

## Future improvement
This program would be more efficient if food options and their cooking instructions are
stored in a more structured database. It would trigger less errors and guide the player to the
correct recipe more efficiently if options are growing. It would help if a “remove” function is
available for player to remove a selected food. This function would pair very interestingly with a
“Calorie” class, which calculates total calories of food selections. This would trigger the player
to change their food options.
